## Get an OpenAI API Key

- First get an [OpenAI API key](https://openai.com/api/).  You will need to provide this key to the Signals & Sorcery server to generate content.

**WARNING:**  Giving out your OpenAI API key is generally a bad idea.  I have no intentions of abusing your key but I also want to be transparent about the risks.  OpenAI recommends against sharing your key with anyone.

**NOTE:**  This is ultimately a prototype.  If its turns out to generate a lot of content I will likely switch to a pay per use model or offer an open source version that you can host yourself.
 

## Provide A world description

The narration and images are based on the description provided.  Here are some ideas:
- A world of Medieval Humanoid Animals
- Steampunk Robot society
- Pirate airship adventures
- Advanced Frog and Toad civilization

## Provide an art style description

The images will be generated based on the art style description.  Here are some ideas:
- Watercolor
- Oil painting
- Line art
- Sepia tone
