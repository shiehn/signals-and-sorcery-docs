## Core Features

### 🎵 AI-Powered Clip Generation
Generate MIDI clips with natural language commands:

- "create a dark sub bass"
- "add a 4 on the floor kick"
- "generate glitchy hi-hats"
- "add a synth pad with reverb"

The AI interprets your description, generates MIDI, and configures Surge XT with appropriate patches.

### 🎛️ DJ-Inspired Dual-Deck Workflow
Built around the core concept of private preview and public performance:

- **Loop A (Composition)** - Generate and preview clips in headphones
- **Loop B (Performance)** - Play approved clips for your audience
- **Transition Deck** - Preview transitions before performing them

### 🤖 Multiple AI Providers
Choose your preferred AI model:

- **OpenAI** - GPT-4 and GPT-5
- **Google Gemini** - Gemini 2.5 and 3
- **Groq** - Fast inference for real-time generation

### 🎧 Audio Routing Modes

Hardware-level support for headphone/main output separation, inspired by professional DJ setups:

- **Solo Mode** - Single output for practice and solo production
- **Audience Mode** - Separate Cue (headphones) and Master (PA/speakers) outputs
- **Stream Mode** - Route Master to OBS/Twitch while monitoring privately in headphones
