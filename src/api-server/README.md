## API

The Signals & Sorcery API is consumed by the following clients:
- [Crucible Plugins](/crucible-plugins/)
- [Runes CLI](/runes-cli/)
- [Runes Client](/runes/)

The API can also be used as a public API for developers who want to create their own clients & plugins.

(API documentation ... coming soon)

## Server

- Application power users who want to extend their applications with self-hosted SOTA AI operations. ex. META releases a new audio generation model and a user wants to use it in their DAW immediately.
- Developers creating Colab/Jupyter notebooks who want to use them in the context of a native application.  ex. A developer creates a new audio stem splitting model and wants to use it in int the context of their DAW.
- API Docs (coming soon ...)

## Self-Host a Server

The Signals & Sorcery server is completely open source and can be self-hosted.  See the [GitHub](https://github.com/shiehn/dawnet-server) for more details.
