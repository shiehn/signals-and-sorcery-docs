## What is Signals & Sorcery?

Signals & Sorcery is a **modern generative music performance platform** that combines AI-powered clip generation with a DJ-inspired dual-deck workflow. Describe the sounds you want in natural language, preview them privately in your headphones, and push approved material to your audience - all in real-time.

The platform features hardware-level audio routing inspired by professional DJ setups: separate headphone (cue) and main outputs let you audition AI-generated clips privately before your audience hears them.

## Who is this for?

- **Generative Music Performers** who want to create and perform AI-generated music live
- **Electronic Musicians** looking for a new approach to live performance with AI assistance
- **Live Coders & Experimental Artists** who want intuitive AI-driven music generation
- **Streamers & Content Creators** who want to generate music in real-time while broadcasting
- **Anyone** who finds traditional live performance setups limiting and wants to explore generative approaches

## How does it work?

### Core Technology

- **Native Audio Engine**: Built on Tracktion Engine (C++) with JSON-RPC communication
- **AI-Powered Generation**: Uses AI providers (OpenAI, Groq, or Gemini) to interpret musical descriptions and generate MIDI
- **Dual-Deck Architecture**: Loop A (composition/preview) and Loop B (performance/audience) with independent routing
- **DJ-Style Monitoring**: Hardware-level support for headphone cue and main outputs
- **Surge XT Integration**: Automatically loads and configures synth patches based on sound descriptions

### The Performance Workflow

1. **Generate** - Describe a sound in natural language ("dark sub bass", "glitchy hi-hats")
2. **Preview** - AI generates clips that play in your headphones (cue output)
3. **Refine** - Iterate on the generation until you're satisfied
4. **Perform** - Push approved clips to the audience (main output)

### Key Features

- **Text-to-Clip Generation**: Describe sounds and get playable MIDI clips with configured synths
- **Private Preview**: Audition generated content in headphones before the audience hears it
- **Seamless Transitions**: Move material between decks for smooth live performances
- **Multiple AI Providers**: Choose between OpenAI, Groq, or Google Gemini
- **Zero-Friction Setup**: Automatic installation of synths and presets on first launch

## Current Limitations

- **macOS Only**: Tested on M-series & Intel chips (Windows/Linux not supported)
- **Surge XT Dependency**: Currently only works with Surge XT synthesizer
- **MIDI-Focused**: Designed for MIDI/synth-based production and performance
