# About

## What is Signals & Sorcery?

Signals & Sorcery is an AI-powered audio production assistant that brings the power of natural language processing to REAPER DAW. Its build with modern web technologies like Langraph & the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Its primary feature is MIDI generation and automatic plugin selection.

## The Vision

We believe that music production should be about creativity, not memorizing shortcuts and menu locations. Signals & Sorcery removes the technical barriers between your ideas and their realization, letting you focus on what matters most - making music.
