# About

## What is Signals & Sorcery?

Signals & Sorcery is an AI-powered audio production assistant that brings the power of natural language processing to REAPER DAW. Built with modern web technologies and the Model Context Protocol (MCP), it enables musicians and producers to control their DAW using conversational commands.

## The Vision

We believe that music production should be about creativity, not memorizing shortcuts and menu locations. Signals & Sorcery removes the technical barriers between your ideas and their realization, letting you focus on what matters most - making music.

## Open Source

Signals & Sorcery is proudly open source and MIT licensed. We believe in the power of community-driven development and welcome contributions from developers around the world.
