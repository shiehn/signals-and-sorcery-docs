# About

## What is Signals & Sorcery?

Signals & Sorcery is a **modern generative music performance platform** that combines AI-powered clip generation with a DJ-inspired dual-deck workflow. Built with modern web technologies (LangGraph & MCP), it features a native audio engine and hardware-level support for headphone/main output routing - letting you generate music privately and perform it publicly.

## The Vision

We believe that generative music performance should be intuitive and immediate. Signals & Sorcery removes the barriers between your ideas and their realization, giving you a platform to generate, preview, and perform AI-created music in real-time.
